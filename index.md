Biography 🎒
======
Hi! I'm Bo Li, a senior undergraduate student from [Software School](https://software.fudan.edu.cn/main.htm), [Fudan University](https://www.fudan.edu.cn/). In 2024 summer, I had the opportunity to work as a research assistant at UNC-Chapel Hill, advised by Prof. [Huaxiu Yao](https://www.huaxiuyao.io/). Prior to that, I served as a research assistant at Fudan University from 2022 to 2024, under the guidance of Prof. [Jingjing Chen](https://fvl.fudan.edu.cn/people/jingjingchen/).

My research interests span across AI alignment, the application of LLMs and VLMs in healthcare, as well as computer vision. I am also very open to exploring other directions（eg. HCI, 3D, embodied intelligence...）. I am eager to engage in research that is closely aligned with real-world applications, and I am particularly interested in exploring how AI research can profoundly reshape the future of scientific inquiry and the broader human society. 

Currently, I am seeking research assistant opportunities in 2025 to further deepen my research interests and expand my scope of research.
