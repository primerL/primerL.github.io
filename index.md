Hi! I'm Bo Li, an undergraduate student from [Fudan University](https://www.fudan.edu.cn/), and currently a research intern at Princeton University advised by Prof. [Zhuang Liu](https://liuzhuang13.github.io/). During this internship, I have the privilege of working closely with amazing collaborators, including [Yida Yin](https://davidyyd.github.io/), [Wenhao Chai](https://wenhaochai.com/) and Dr. [Xingyu Fu](https://zeyofu.github.io/). 

Previously, I worked as a research assistant at UNC-Chapel Hill (advised by Prof. [Huaxiu Yao](https://www.huaxiuyao.io/)) and at Fudan University (advised by Prof. [Jingjing Chen](https://fvl.fudan.edu.cn/people/jingjingchen/)).

My research interests include, but are not limited to, AI alignment, unified models for multimodal understanding and generation, and benchmarks and evaluation.
